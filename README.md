# Neeliharitha - Data Science

Welcome to my GitHub profile! Here, you'll find a collection of my data science projects and explorations. I'm passionate about using data to gain insights and solve real-world problems. Feel free to explore the repositories and reach out to me if you have any questions or collaborations in mind.

## Projects

### Project 1: 

In this project, I developed a predictive model to predict **customer churn**. The repository includes the dataset, Jupyter Notebook with the analysis, and the trained model. I used various machine learning algorithms and evaluated their performance to determine the most accurate model for churn prediction.

### Project 2: Ongoing

In this project, I conducted **sentiment analysis** on "Amazon product reviews dataset" and  developed a **product recommend system**. I built a deep learning model using natural language processing techniques to classify the sentiment of each post as positive, negative, or neutral. The repository includes the dataset, preprocessing steps, and the trained model for sentiment classification and collaborative filtering recommend system.
