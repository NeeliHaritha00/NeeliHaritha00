# Neeliharitha - Data Science

Welcome to my GitHub profile! Here, you'll find a collection of my data science projects and explorations. I'm passionate about using data to gain insights and solve real-world problems. Feel free to explore the repositories and reach out to me if you have any questions or collaborations in mind.

## Projects

### Project 1: 

In this project, I developed a predictive model to forecast sales based on historical data. The repository includes the dataset, Jupyter Notebook with the analysis, and the trained model. I used various machine learning algorithms and evaluated their performance to determine the most accurate model for sales prediction.

### Project 2: 

In this project, I performed customer segmentation using clustering techniques. The repository contains the dataset, data preprocessing steps, and a Jupyter Notebook detailing the segmentation process. I explored different clustering algorithms and visualized the results to identify distinct customer groups based on their behavior and attributes.

### Project 3: 

In this project, I conducted sentiment analysis on a large dataset of social media posts. I built a deep learning model using natural language processing techniques to classify the sentiment of each post as positive, negative, or neutral. The repository includes the dataset, preprocessing steps, and the trained model for sentiment classification.
